										"The Small kingdom of Bardoran was founded by Barus Torid in 1442 CE. Similar to the kingdoms around, Bardoran was a small mining kingdom with little actual power or class system. At the time, there was only the miner middle class and the leading upper class where the miners would get resources and the leaders would manage and sell the resources. Bardoran sustained itself by selling raw minerals to nearby nations with processing infrastructure in exchange for food.",
										"In 1545, Torid retired and gave his crown to Dremin Warberset, a close advisor. Previous to this, Warberset had helped to negotiate trade deals with the nearby nations where he would sell raw materials in exchange tools, or a cut of processed metal for use of their forges. These greatly increased the quality of life for Bardoran miners, as well as their efficiency. This along with Warbersetâ€™s vision of a united dwarven kingdom made Torid feel Warberset would be a good king.",
										"Over time, the citizens of Bardoran and Warberset himself began to become frustrated with nearby nations encroaching and forming trade agreements without Bardoran. Kershak took advantage of this frustration and made a deal with Warberset. With Kershakâ€™s help, Bardoran easily took over its previously equally matched neighboring nations. Bardoran used the claimed resources to grow a powerful military force, and with the help of Kershak, conquered the north.
